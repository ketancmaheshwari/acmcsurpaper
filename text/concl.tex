Figure \ref{fig:taxonomy} shows a taxonomy of SWE features studied in this
paper. We studied twenty SWEs from different scientific fields developed
worldwide. Some trends as observed in the approaches of the SWEs development
are noted below:

\begin{itemize}
 \item A recent surge in distributed computing approach of Cloud Computing has
     given rise to adoption of new enactment technologies. 

 \item SWEs tend to offer complementary properties which has led to several
     collaborations among the developing groups. Notable among these are the
     recent ones between Taverna and Galaxy \cite{mohamed-alaa-etal:2010} and
     Kepler and Pegasus \cite{mandal-deelman-etal:2007}.
 
 \item Collection oriented SWEs wherein arrays of data are treated as
     first-class entities has been seen a significant trend among the
     contemporary SWEs.
 
 \item A trend of increasing number of SWEs providing a script-based workflow
     composition interface solely or in combination with a visual interface in
     the form of GUI has been observed.
 
 \item Workflow systems originally developed for business domains have been
     introduced to scientific domains, such as BPEL and Trident.
\end{itemize}

In the present work we explore different dimensions of SWE paradigm. We study a
number of SWE implementations. While we see a number of implementations
dominant in areas suitable to their targeted applications, there is no single
SWE that could sufficiently fulfill the objectives of this work. There is a
lack of an SWE addressing the workflow expressibility and parallelism
requirements while at the same time targeting enactment within the Grid
Environment. Key features such as effective application data combinations or
array-based execution coupled with Grid centric execution are either missing or
partially available in the studied workflows. 

However, so far, from our study, we find Taverna as being the closest SWE that
can be a suitable candidate for our enactments. With this motivation, we get
into studying the details of the workings of the Taverna Workflow Environment. 

While many contemporary SWEs are studied in this survey, we are aware that this
is not an exhaustive list. Some other SWEs have been missed or omitted, notable
among them being: ICENI~\cite{furmento-mayer-etal:2002},
Calcium~\cite{caromel-henrio-etal:2008} and YML~\cite{delannoy-emad-etal:2006}.
