\km{TODO: Expand in the end}

In this work we conduct a literature survey of the key features of the
contemporary scientific workflow environments. We define the criteria for the
survey based chiefly on user needs arising from diverse applications and
infrastructure. An overview of studied scientific workflow environments is
presented followed by the identification and description of the features offered by
each of the environment. A tabulated summary for each feature class gives a
high-level view of the offered features. Finally, a taxonomy is proposed
placing these features into respective places in a hierarchy.

% At a minimum you need to supply the author names, year and a title.
% IMPORTANT:
% Full first names whenever they are known, surname last, followed by a period.
% In the case of two authors, 'and' is placed between them.
% In the case of three or more authors, the serial comma is used, that is, all author names
% except the last one but including the penultimate author's name are followed by a comma,
% and then 'and' is placed before the final author's name.
% If only first and middle initials are known, then each initial
% is followed by a period and they are separated by a space.
% The remaining information (journal title, volume, article number, date, etc.) is 'auto-generated'.

\section{Overview of the Workflow Environments} \label{sec:overview}
In this section we present an overview of the SWEs studied. The paragraph
headers are organized by the name of the SWE followed by the name of internal
representation language use and support separated by a forward slash (/).  The
cases where an intermediate language is not specifically defined or conversely
where there are multiple systems supporting a generic representation are
denoted by an asterisk (*) or a hyphen (-) at the respective places.

% Put this in analysis section. 
%The \textit{gscript}~\cite{maheshwari-montagnat:2010} workflow language
%is similar in spirit to the SwiftScript. Similar to SwiftScript, gscript adopts futures to express
%asynchronous execution in a script-based language. A Swift script 
%contains statically typed datasets that can be declared
%in the script. Unlike Swift script, gscript does provide user-defined
%strategies in order to effect data combinations in the workflow. The underlying datasets organization in Swift is
%represented using XML-representation. This means that effectively, a
%workflow is a DAG. A workflow is
%simpler and compact in gscript as its data description is embedded within a
%workflow representation. Conditional and Loop execution is supported
%using the if and foreach statements in both languages.
